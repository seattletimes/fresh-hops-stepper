If we can get them in the kettle, if we can get them in the whirlpool,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.380
if we can get them in the mash tun,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.360
where we're going to be doing a giant steep,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.240
and then even on the way out of the mash tun,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.780
we try to get one more bag on that wort.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.590
So it's almost, get as much liquid that will become beer

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.599
touching these hops as possible.
