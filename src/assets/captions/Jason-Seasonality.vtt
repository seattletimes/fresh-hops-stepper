If you're located in the Pacific Northwest,

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.780
you're at an advantage when it comes to wet hops, you know.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.860
To be able to go direct, drive to the farm

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.860
within two, three, four, five hours, even,

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.480
and be able to drive get, those hops,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.140
and then have them in the brew kettle that same day.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.700
I think that's one of the great things about it, is that seasonality.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.900
And that's what makes it so special.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.320
If you can do it year-round it wouldn't be not near as special.
