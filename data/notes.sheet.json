    "TITLE": "Jason - when you see something like fresh hops where the hops are front and center and we get to put a face to the customer -- it makes us better growers because we want to do better for them. If you look at the quality of the hops coming out of the YV, it's improved leaps and bounds and part of that is due to fresh hops. "

    "TITLE": "Jason - Certainly if you're in the PNW, you're at an advantage when it comes to fresh hops. To be able to drive to a farm within 2, 3 4 5 hours and get those hops and put them in the brew kettle that day, it's a big deal for brewers to use hops that fresh whether wet or dry"

    "TITLE": "Steve - If we can get them in the kettle, if we can get them into the whirlpool, if we can get them in this mash ton where we're gonna  be doing a giant steep and even on the way out of the mash ton we're gonna try to get one more bag on that wort. It's almost like, get as much liquid that will become beer touching these hops as possible in basically a 3 to 5 hour time span. "
  },
  {
    "TITLE": "Steve- One of the biggest factors of fresh hop beers is just that chewy, chlorolphyiic, like vegetative note. And finding that balanace not to have it feel like you're just chewing on lettuce while you're drinking a beer. That's kind of defining characteristic of these beers.  In baalcne with really intense flavor and hop aroma.   "
  },
  {
    "TITLE": "Steve -  a little over 300 punds of simcoe in 15 barrels of wort in this giant sort of hop tub. That's kind of where we'll be stirring it pretty much constantly just so that every cone gets wet and we let it rest for about 20 minutes. And sort of restart the wort through. And that's the most crucial part in terms of making a fresh hop beer, wet hop beer is that we do this extra crazy massive pot of hop tea basically before we're knocking it out into the fermenter.  "

  {
    "TITLE": "Steve - this time of year is so unique and it takes a lot of time and effort to put into to make these beers and I think craft brew drinkers realize that and appreciate that as well. "
